# Machine-Learning-Based-Speech-Emotion-Recognition
This project utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), for speech emotion recognition using machine learning techniques. The LSTM model is trained on a dataset of speech samples labeled with various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more.
